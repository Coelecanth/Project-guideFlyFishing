In this section, you need to convince the assessors that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well.
Essentially, in this part, you should go over all of your project's features, and ensure that they all work as intended,
with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Feature-by-Feature Testing:

Go through each feature of your portfolio site and detail the testing process for each.

Explain the functionality and demonstrate how it aligns with the intended purpose. This could include:

- Navigation: Ensuring smooth transitions between pages, links directing to the correct destinations.
- Responsive Design: Checking for compatibility across various devices and screen sizes.
- Portfolio Display: Verifying that projects are properly showcased with accurate descriptions, images, and links.
- Contact Form: Testing the form submission process, ensuring the user receives a confirmation, and you receive the message.

User Experience Testing:

- Usability Testing: Have users (or simulated users) interact with the site and provide feedback. Document any issues encountered and the resolutions implemented.
- Accessibility Testing: Confirm compliance with accessibility standards (e.g., screen reader compatibility, proper alt text for images, keyboard navigation).

Compatibility Testing:

- Browser Compatibility: Testing on different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, etc.) to ensure consistent performance.
- Device Compatibility: Ensuring functionality across various devices (desktops, laptops, tablets, and mobile phones).
- Performance Testing (optional):
	- Speed and Load Testing: Tools like PageSpeed Insights or GTmetrix to check page load times and optimize where necessary.
	- Scalability Testing: Assess how the site handles increased traffic or usage.

Regression Testing:

After implementing fixes or updates, ensure that previous features and functionalities still work as intended. This prevents new changes from breaking existing features.

Documentation and Logs:

Maintain records of testing procedures, results, and any bugs encountered along with their resolutions. This helps demonstrate a systematic approach to testing and problem-solving.
User Feedback Incorporation:

If applicable, mention how user feedback has been taken into account and implemented to enhance the user experience.

## Code Validation

🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑-START OF NOTES (to be deleted)

Use the space to discuss code validation for any of your own code files (where applicable).
You are not required to validate external libraries/frameworks, such as imported Bootstrap, Materialize, Font Awesome, etc.

**IMPORTANT**: You must provide a screenshot for each file you validate.

**PRO TIP**: Always validate the live site pages, not your local code. There could be subtle/hidden differences.

## Browser Compatibility

🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑-START OF NOTES (to be deleted)

Use this space to discuss testing the live/deployed site on various browsers.

Consider testing AT LEAST 3 different browsers, if available on your system.

You DO NOT need to use all of the browsers below, just pick any 3 (minimum).

Recommended browsers to consider:
- [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome)
- [Firefox (Developer Edition)](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/developer)
- [Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/edge)
- [Safari](https://support.apple.com/downloads/safari)
- [Brave](https://brave.com/download)
- [Opera](https://www.opera.com/download)

**IMPORTANT**: You must provide screenshots of the tested browsers, to "prove" that you've actually tested them.

Please note, there are services out there that can test multiple browser compatibilities at the same time.
Some of these are paid services, but some are free.
If you use these, you must provide a link to the source used for attribution, and multiple screenshots of the results.

## Responsiveness

🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑-START OF NOTES (to be deleted)

Use this space to discuss testing the live/deployed site on various device sizes.

The minimum requirement is for the following 3 tests:
- Mobile
- Tablet
- Desktop

**IMPORTANT**: You must provide screenshots of the tested responsiveness, to "prove" that you've actually tested them.

Using the "amiresponsive" mockup image (or similar) does not suffice the requirements.
Consider using some of the built-in device sizes in the Developer Tools.

If you have tested the project on your actual mobile phone or tablet, consider also including screenshots of these as well.
It showcases a higher level of manual tests, and can be seen as a positive inclusion!

## Lighthouse Audit

🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑-START OF NOTES (to be deleted)

Use this space to discuss testing the live/deployed site's Lighthouse Audit reports.
Avoid testing the local version (especially if developing in Gitpod), as this can have knock-on effects of performance.

If you don't have Lighthouse in your Developer Tools,
it can be added as an [extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/lighthouse/blipmdconlkpinefehnmjammfjpmpbjk).

Don't just test the home page (unless it's a single-page application).
Make sure to test the Lighthouse Audit results for all of your pages.

**IMPORTANT**: You must provide screenshots of the results, to "prove" that you've actually tested them.

## Defensive Programming

🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑-START OF NOTES (to be deleted)

Defensive programming (defensive design) is extremely important!

When building projects that accept user inputs or forms, you should always test the level of security for each.
Examples of this could include (not limited to):

Forms:
- Users cannot submit an empty form
- Users must enter valid email addresses

PP3 (Python-only):
- Users must enter a valid letter/word/string when prompted
- Users must choose from a specific list only

MS3 (Flask) | MS4/PP4/PP5 (Django):
- Users cannot brute-force a URL to navigate to a restricted page
- Users cannot perform CRUD functionality while logged-out
- User-A should not be able to manipulate data belonging to User-B, or vice versa
- Non-Authenticated users should not be able to access pages that require authentication
- Standard users should not be able to access pages intended for superusers

You'll want to test all functionality on your application, whether it's a standard form,
or uses CRUD functionality for data manipulation on a database.
Make sure to include the `required` attribute on any form-fields that should be mandatory.
Try to access various pages on your site as different user types (User-A, User-B, guest user, admin, superuser).

You should include any manual tests performed, and the expected results/outcome.

Testing should be replicable.
Ideally, tests cases should focus on each individual section of every page on the website.
Each test case should be specific, objective, and step-wise replicable.

Instead of adding a general overview saying that everything works fine,
consider documenting tests on each element of the page
(ie. button clicks, input box validation, navigation links, etc.) by testing them in their happy flow,
and also the bad/exception flow, mentioning the expected and observed results,
and drawing a parallel between them where applicable.

Consider using the following format for manual test cases:

Expected Outcome / Test Performed / Result Received / Fixes Implemented

- **Expected**: "Feature is expected to do X when the user does Y."
- **Testing**: "Tested the feature by doing Y."
- (either) **Result**: "The feature behaved as expected, and it did Y."
- (or) **Result**: "The feature did not respond to A, B, or C."
- **Fix**: "I did Z to the code because something was missing."

Use the table below as a basic start, and expand on it using the logic above.

🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑-END OF NOTES (to be deleted)

Defensive programming was manually tested with the below user acceptance testing:

| Page | Expectation | Test | Result | Fix | Screenshot |

Testing user stories is actually quite simple, once you've already got the stories defined on your README.

Most of your project's **features** should already align with the **user stories**,
so this should as simple as creating a table with the user story, matching with the re-used screenshot
from the respective feature.

## Bugs
**PRO TIP**: screenshots of bugs are extremely helpful, and go a long way!

### Bootstrap errors not targetting navbar elements correctly  

When i first setup Boot strap navbar using version 5.3, the drop down menus did not function correctly, as when you clickd on the 
the menu it did not drop down. After some very extensive research and collaboration, this was found to be a problem with changes
in bootstrap version 4.0 used in walkthrough and version 5.3    
the data target element in html has been updated in bootstrap 5.3 from
data-target 
to 
data-bs-target

Once corrected with data-bs-target in main.nav to define as a target this all worked  
This change was made in 5.3 to allow mutiple styling frameworks to be used. 

### Receiving errors when i push my Code to gitHub
    After Renaming my project in gitpod - to conform with naming guidance I started receiving the following error when I pushed code. 
    ```shell
            remote: Resolving deltas: 100% (1/1), completed with 1 local object.
            remote: This repository moved. Please use the new location:
            remote:   https://github.com/Coelecanth/Project4-guideflyfishing.git
            To https://github.com/Coelecanth/Project-guideFlyFishing.git
    ```
    The error is quite self explanatory, once I had correctly renamed the github site the errors were removed and and push worked without errors 

### Couldnt deploy App in heroku with Auto Deploy     
    Received the following error in the Heroku log when trying to build app in heroku   

    	```shell

    	```
    Heroku would not build and deploy python app, using Autodeploy in Heroku.  
    The above log excerpt from heroku build shows there is an issue with Allauth app, this was corrected by 
    moving from version 0041 as prescribed in the project walkthrough and moving to later version of 0054
    this was installed using the following command  pip3 install django-allauth==0.54.0
    

### When loading alternate imnage in Bag view would get a Django error saying image not found 

    On investigation there was not any checking for the image existeance in the bag page, and as this did not need to be linked to nay other 
    I added some tempalte logic testing to make sure this worked corectly 

    To fix this i added the following code 
```html
<!-- Original code -->
    <td class="p-3 w-25">
        <img class="img-fluid rounded" src="{{ item.product.image.url }}">
    </td>

<!-- Revised fix     -->
    <td class="p-3 w-25">
    {% if item.product.image %} 
        <img class="img-fluid rounded" src="{{ item.product.image.url }}">
    {% else %}
        <img class="card-img-top img-fluid" src="{% static 'img/noimage.jpg' %}">
    {% endif %}
    </td>

```


### The Update button in the Bag page does update the values

the Update function in the bag does not work and behaves like there is no link. This wwas found to be a problem with the location of the tags in Bag.html,
which intiate the JS script to implement this function, the following code snippets how the before and after for bag.html 
    To fix this i added the following code was changed 
```html
<!-- Original code -->
            <button class="increment-qty btn btn-sm btn-black rounded-0"
                    data-item_id="{{ item.item_id }}" id="increment-qty_{{ item.item_id }}">
                    <span><i class="fas fa-plus fa-sm"></i></span>
            </button>
            </div>
            </div>
        </div>
    <a class="update-link text-dark float-left"><small>Update</small></a>
    <a class="remove-item text-danger float-rig ht" id="remove_{{ item.item_id }}"><small>Remove</small></a>
    </form>    

<!-- Revised fix     -->
             <button class="increment-qty btn btn-sm btn-black rounded-0"
                    data-item_id="{{ item.item_id }}" id="increment-qty_{{ item.item_id }}">
                    <span><i class="fas fa-plus fa-sm"></i></span>
            </button>
            </div>
            </div>
        </div>
        </form>
        <!-- Do not put links inside the form as this break the update funcxtion it should remain outside the form tag -->
        <a class="update-link text-dark float-left"><small>Update</small></a>
        <a class="remove-item text-danger float-right" id="remove_{{ item.item_id }}"><small>Remove</small></a>

### Toast messages in the Appl;ication did not apply corectly  

    Following the course guidance on implementing toasts in the project walk through, the explanation omitted details 
    on the implementation of toast messages. In particualr it was not expalined that the implemetation 
    described would produce a toast message only on the first addition of an item to the bag. It was not clear 
    if was an oversite or by design. In my implementation I wanted the toast message to appear 
    everytime an item was added to the bag.    

    To fix this i amended/added the following code to views.py in Bag app 
```python

# Original code - where toast is only raised on the first 
def add_to_bag(request, item_id):
    """ Add a quantity of the specified product to the shopping bag """

    product = trips.objects.get(pk=item_id)
    quantity = int(request.POST.get('quantity'))
    redirect_url = request.POST.get('redirect_url')
    bag = request.session.get('bag', {})

    if item_id in list(bag.keys()):
        bag[item_id] += quantity
        # missing code element here here to 
        # call toast message on subsequent additions
    else:
        bag[item_id] = quantity
        messages.success(request, f'Added {product.venue} to your bag')

    request.session['bag'] = bag
    return redirect(redirect_url)

# Revised code to provide toasts on all additions to the bag
def add_to_bag(request, item_id):
    """ Add a quantity of the specified product to the shopping bag """

    product = trips.objects.get(pk=item_id)
    quantity = int(request.POST.get('quantity'))
    redirect_url = request.POST.get('redirect_url')
    bag = request.session.get('bag', {})

    if item_id in list(bag.keys()):
        bag[item_id] += quantity
        # call toast message on subsequent additions
        messages.success(request, f'Added {product.venue} to your bag')
    else:
        bag[item_id] = quantity
        messages.success(request, f'Added {product.venue} to your bag')

    request.session['bag'] = bag
    return redirect(redirect_url)


```

## Unfixed Bugs

🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑-START OF NOTES (to be deleted)

You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed.
This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used.
Although time can be a big variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding
implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed.

If you've identified any unfixed bugs, no matter how small, be sure to list them here.
It's better to be honest and list them, because if it's not documented and an assessor finds the issue,
they need to know whether or not you're aware of them as well, and why you've not corrected/fixed them.

Some examples:

🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑-END OF NOTES (to be deleted)

- On devices smaller than 375px, the page starts to have `overflow-x` scrolling.

    ![screenshot](documentation/bugs/unfixed-bug01.png)

    - Attempted fix: I tried to add additional media queries to handle this, but things started becoming too small to read.

- For PP3, when using a helper `clear()` function, any text above the height of the terminal does not clear, and remains when you scroll up.

    ![screenshot](documentation/bugs/unfixed-bug02.png)

    - Attempted fix: I tried to adjust the terminal size, but it only resizes the actual terminal, not the allowable area for text.

- When validating HTML with a semantic `section` element, the validator warns about lacking a header `h2-h6`. This is acceptable.

    ![screenshot](documentation/bugs/unfixed-bug03.png)

    - Attempted fix: this is a known warning and acceptable, and my section doesn't require a header since it's dynamically added via JS.

🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑-START OF NOTES (to be deleted)

If you legitimately cannot find any unfixed bugs or warnings, then use the following sentence:

🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑-END OF NOTES (to be deleted)

> [!NOTE]  
> There are no remaining bugs that I am aware of.
